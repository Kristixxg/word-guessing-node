# word-guessing-node


## Description 

* This app is a word guessing game that requires users to use constructor functions on the command-line.

* This game uses `Node.js` and `Inquirer` package. The `index.js` file will be the javascript file that runs the game and has a dependency on the word.js file for the array of movie names/title.

* The `Word.js` file, on the other hand, uses the `<require()>` function to read the the `Letter.js` file that stores the letters guessed.


* The game will select a random movie title.
```
Start the game by typing `npm start` in the terminal. The game will then load and you will see underscores `_ ___ ____`.

If you guessed the correct letter, it will show a green alert message "CORRECT!". If you guessed the wrong letter, it will show a red green alert message "INCORRECT!"

Users only get 10 guesses on the letters. If your guesses run out, there will be a message showing "No guesses left!" and the correct word(s).

There will also be another message asking user if they want to play again and choose "(Y/n)".

If user chooses "y", then they can continue guessing the next movie title.

If user chooses "n", then the game will end and the message will show "Goodbye!". 
```
